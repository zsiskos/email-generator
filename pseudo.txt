Email randomizer

Overall ask: 
- want a website to generate account emails that satisfy your security requirements
- bonus is if it sets up the email in your server
- Stretch goal: to give user ability to change variables for emails (i.e. total number of characters)


Specifics:
- accessible by mobile
- max. number of characters - 29 (can have 64 chars before @, 255 in domain part, total of 320) but does not always have to be 29 characters
- account title, based on input from user
- alphanumeric prior to and after the account title, random order, selection, length
- min of 5 characters before and after the account title
- no spaces, no special characters
- no need to add domain, just ability to copy to clipboard and email (unless it hooks into an api for the server, then will need to select domain)


input takes emailTitle - user hit generate
picks number for length between 15 and 29, store that in charaterTotal
counts the number of characters in emailTitle + 2
subtract that from characterTotal and store new number
it randomly assign number b/w 0-9 
puts number on either side of emailTitle
take characterTotal and it will randomly generate number from 5 - (characterTotal - 5)
store new number in emailFrontTotal
emailFront is generated randomly, length based on emailFrontTotal
add emailFront to emailTitle
take charaterTotal and subtract emailFrontTotal for emailBackTotal
emailBack is generated based on this total
add emailBack to emailTitle
Display emailTitle
Display copy and email buttons
