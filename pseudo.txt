Email randomizer

Overall ask: 
- want a website to generate account emails that satisfy your security requirements
- bonus is if it sets up the email in your server
- Stretch goal: to give user ability to change variables for emails (i.e. total number of characters)


Specifics:
- accessible by mobile
- max. number of characters - 29 (can have 64 chars before @, 255 in domain part, total of 320) but does not always have to be 29 characters
- account title, based on input from user
- alphanumeric prior to and after the account title, random order, selection, length
- min of 5 characters before and after the account title
- no spaces, no special characters
- no need to add domain, just ability to copy to clipboard and email (unless it hooks into an api for the server, then will need to select domain)


input takes emailTitle - user hits generate
randomly generate numbers for:
- emailFrontLength (b/w 5 - 15)
- emailBackLength (b/w 5 - 15)
- randomNumber ( 0 - 9)

if:
- total number is greater than 55 regenerate numbers

- randomly generates two separate strings based on emailFrontLength and emailBackLength (alphanumeric only)


output emailFront + randomNumber + emailTitle + randomNumber + emailBack
display copy and email buttons







input takes emailTitle - user hit generate
picks number for emailLength between 15 and 29, store that in emailLength
counts the number of characters in emailTitle + 2
subtract that from emailLength and store new number
it randomly assign number b/w 0-9 

take emailLength and it will randomly generate number from 5 - (emailLength - 5)
store new number in emailFrontLength

emailFront is generated randomly, length based on emailFrontLength

take emailLength and subtract emailFrontLength for emailBackLength
emailBack is generated based on this total

Display emailTitle - 
emailFront +  randomNumber +  emailTitle + randomNumber +emailBack

Display copy and email buttons
